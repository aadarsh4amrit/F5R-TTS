## Introduction

Text-to-speech technology has come a long way, but there is still room for improvement in how natural and expressive the generated speech sounds. F5R-TTS aims to bridge this gap by utilizing flow-matching techniques and optimizing policies in a group setting. 

This project is designed for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts interested in advancing TTS systems. 

## Features

- **Improved Naturalness**: Generate speech that sounds more human-like.
- **Expressive Speech**: Adjust tone and inflection for better emotional delivery.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing applications.
- **Open Source**: Collaborate and contribute to the project.
